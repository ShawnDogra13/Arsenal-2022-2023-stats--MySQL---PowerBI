Findings
* Arsenal had 88 goals for and 43 goals against after the 22/23 season, giving them a goal differential of +45.

* The goal distrbution maintained a stagnant trend across the total shots generated. Arsenal generated 45 shots (the most shots), & produced 6 goals (second most goals)
  against Bournemouth. However, Arsenals most productive game was against Wolves in which they generated 7 goals with 28 shots taken. Additionally,
  Arsenal generated the fewest shots (17) & goals (2) against Manchester City but the rest of the data held no significant fluctuations in the trend.
* The average goal conversion rate from the total shots taken was 0.15 (15%).

* Only 4 teams scored equal or more goals than Arsenal when they faced off. Those teams were: Man City (goal diff = -5), Brighton (goal diff = -1), Man United (goal diff = -1), &
  Southampton (goal diff = 0). Arsenals highest goal difference was against Wolves with a difference of +7.

* Arsenals average possession for the season was 59.3%.

* Arsenal acheived a win in two games against 47% of the competition (9 teams), and a win in one game against 42% of the competition (8 games).
* Arsenal lost two games against 5% of the competition (1 team), and lost one games against 21% of the competition (4 teams).
* Arsenal drew two games against 5% of the competition (1 team), and drew one game against 21% of the competition (4 teams).
* The only two teams that Arsenal did not win against is: Manchester City (two losses), & Southampton (two draws).

* The distribution of results across venues were as followed: Home wins - 14, home losses - 2, home draws - 3,
  Away wins - 12, Away losses- 4, & Away draws - 3.

* Matchweek 6 had the highest attendance with 73,431 people and matchweek 3 had the lowest attendance with 10,423 people present.

* The trend between the average possession and total shots holds a positive correlation; if one variable decreases the other does as well.

* The correlation between total completed passes and shots generated is highly variable and does not follow a specific trend.

Analysis Summary 
  
  Although Arsenal had a successful season in terms of their win distribution and positive goal differential, the data shows Arsenal may lack 
  efficiency.
  Arsenal was able to create a fair amount of opportunities that led to a shot but only converted those shots into goals 15% of the time. Additionally, 
  Arsenal holds the majority of possession with an average of 59% but has a variable trend between possession & shots generated. This highlights their inconsistent 
  productivity with creating scoring opportunities when they have the ball. Furthermore, this indicates that Arsenal may be making a lot of passes side to side rather than 
  taking more risks attempting penetrating forward passes. 
  Lastly, aquiring a forward with a higher goal conversion rate that can score with less created chances can improve Arsenals efficiency. 

Limitations
* The dataset did not include statistics of the other teams. 
* Individual player data was not included, which could have been used to further support the findings.
* No specific data such as field location was available to further breakdown where possession & shots came from on the field.
